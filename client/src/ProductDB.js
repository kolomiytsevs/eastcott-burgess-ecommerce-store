     description:<div><p><em><strong>This is a modern style Autumn 2017&nbsp;Tie Guan Yin, grown and processed in&nbsp;the most prized terroir for Tie Guan Yin of Changkeng township.</strong></em></p><p><strong>A bit of background</strong></p><p>After trying to organise a group buy for the Autumn TGY harvest, I ordered this one in as it seemed like the most promising. Having been sent a tonne of information by the producers in Chinese I went about trying to decipher it all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is a light Xiao Zheng Tie Guan Yin from Changkeng (Anxi), which was picked in November 2017. I was interested to see what it had in store, as this was my first time trying a non Zheng Wei TGY (meaning the kill green had been delayed until the next noon rather than the morning).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Leaf</strong></p><p>Opening the packet, it hits you. That freshness, that greenery, and that slight hint of a floral bouquet. I pour it into the lid of the Gawain and breathe through the leaves to warm them up. After the second breath, the scents start to evaporate. It’s pleasant, a strong lilac aroma, mixed with something that I can only describe as ‘the green core of a walnut’… a rather strange analogy, I know.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Visually, I am impressed, the leaves are tightly rolled, with a large array of greens colouring the leaves. &nbsp;There’s no dust in the packet and after a good shake in the Gaiwan, only a few specks of broken leaf stick to the damp lid.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I heat the water to 80C (instead of the often recommended 99C) and hit it with its first steeping, a quick 10 second hit to open up the leaves. The initial smell of the leaves is very pleasant, and has everything that I’ve come to love from a Tie Guan Yin, freshness, a slight floralness, and something very spinachy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>First Real Steeping</strong></p><p>Having hit the leaves with their 20/30 second steeping, the tea changes. On the nose, that grassy (or walnutty) freshness starts to come through even more, along with a few of those lilac notes. The liquor is a greeny yellow colour, which is promising. It’s certainly smooth in the mouth, with a buttery sweetness to it. Holding it for a second and breathing out through your nose, you get a lot of those slightly duller lilac notes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Continuous Steepings</strong></p><p>With every steeping, this TGY gets more and more vegetal and remains delicate, with the floral aspect holding up well steeping after steeping (with a nice flavour even after about 8 steepings). If held for a long time, there is a slight minerality on the sides of the tongue. I think this may be what Xiao Zheng processing brings out in this tea. The Chinese describe it as a slight acidity, but I wouldn’t quite agree with that. It’s not so much of an acidity as a minerality on the sides of the tongue (in my opinion), although I can see where the acidic association comes from.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As the leaves open up and fill up the Gawain, I like what I see. The leaves are nicely formed, with rough, broken, slightly reddish edges from the beating process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Concluding Remarks</strong></p><p>In general, I am impressed, which is why I am putting out a small portion of it for sale on our website.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The tea has a complex aroma and flavour, with notes of lilac, spinach, and a sweet butteryness. It holds up reasonably well to many steepings and in general seems to be a good, light and refreshing TGY.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sasha</p></div>,

     description:<p><i>This is a traditional style <b>Spring 2018 Tie Guan Yin </b> tea, grown and hand-made in very small quantities in the most prized terroir of the steep slopes of the mountain peaks of Gande township &#40;at a high altitude in the mountains, rather than in Gande town itself&#41; by Master Sujindui and his wife WuLaiYing.</i> <br /> <br /> <b>Summary of Flavour:</b>  it switches between savoury and sweet notes. Savoury notes of acacia flowers, steamed spinach and faint notes of butter. Sweet notes of nectar, single cream and limetree flowers. Faint hint of ripe apricot sweetnes. Less vegetal, and deeper, more sublte flavour, compared to Qing Xiang. You can make this into either a savoury, or a sweet tea, depending on how you brew it &#40;see the Steeping Suggestions section on the right&#41;
     <br/>
      <b>Tea Master:</b> Sujindui
      <br/>
      <b>Collected By:</b> WuLaiYing &#40;Sujindui's wife&#41;

      <br/>
      <b> Location:</b> Yangshan Cun, Gande, Anxi, Fujian, China
      <br/>
      <b>Type:</b> Light Oolong Tea
      <br/>
      <b>Altitude:</b> 1500-1700 metres above sea level. 1700m according to tea master and his neighbours.

      <b> Date of Plucking and Processing:</b> 8-10th May, 2018
      <br/>
      <b>Time of Kill Green:</b> Xiao Zheng &#40;next noon after plucking&#41;
      <br/>
       
      
      <b>Tea Description &#40;Our Experience&#41; - Extra Detail:</b>
      <br/>
      <b>Dry Leaves:</b>  we can smell yellow acacia flowers, hint of honey, flowers
      <br/>
      <b>Wet Leaves:</b> we think it smells of buttered yellow acacia, nectar, spring honey; a balance of sweet and savoury
      <br/>
      <b>Taste:</b> we think that it switches between savoury and sweet notes. Savoury notes of acacia flowers, steamed spinach and faint notes of butter. Sweet notes of flower nectar, single cream and limetree flowers. Faint hint of ripe apricot sweetness
      <br/>
      <b>Cup/Lid:</b> we can smell faint notes of honey and nectar
      <br/>
      <b>Mouthfeel:</b> we feel it has a smooth, yet light and refreshing sensation 
      <br/>
      <b>Note:</b> to avoid disappointment, this is a traditional style Tie Guan Yin, meaning that it is very different to the more aromatic modern style Tie Guan Yin tea we are so used to here in the West, and may therefore require a higher level of experience to understand it.</p>,

        <p><strong>1. Savoury Style</strong></p>
        
        <p>o&nbsp;<strong>Water temperature:</strong>&nbsp;95C/203F</p>
        
        <p>o <strong>Water type:</strong> we strongly recommend to use water that most closely resembles the birthplace water of this tea e.g. sweet spring bottled water</p>
        
        <p>o<strong>&nbsp;Leaf to water ratio: </strong>7&nbsp;grams for standard gaiwan</p>
        
        <p>o<strong>&nbsp;Method:&nbsp;</strong>flush the leaves with 95C&nbsp;water for 4 seconds to cleanse the tea leaves &#40;as per the Chinese tradition&#41;, to warm them up and to allow them to expand and open up slightly.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>Steep the first brew for 14&nbsp;seconds with 95C water and keep increasing the steeping time with 4&nbsp;seconds with each subsequent brew.&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>We like to enjoy this tea up to 9&nbsp;steepings. It can do more steepings, but we prefer the first 9.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><strong>2. Sweeter Style</strong></p>
        
        <p>All the steps are the same as above, but just reduce your water temperature to 85C - 90C &#40;185F - 194F&#41;, and skip the rinse step, get straight to brewing.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>This is our favourite way to drink this Long Xiang &#40;so great choice ;&#41; !</p></div>,

        body:<div><p><span><span>This is a traditional Long Xiang &#40;Nong Xiang&#41; Tie Guan Yin &#40;Long Xiang meaningful translation means deep body and lower frequency fragrance&#41;. A comparison is often made with Qing Xiang &#40;lighter and aromatic fragrance&#41;, which was influenced by Taiwanese Tie Guan Yin production and a strong demand for more aromatic and fragrant tea by tea lovers. Long Xiang requires greater attention and appreciation of its flavour and scent, as each brewing releases a constant strength of flavour&nbsp;and subtle notes, rather than a strong and rapidly released punch of fragrance, which is more typical of Qing Xiang.</span></span></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><span><span>A traditional Long Xiang has a strong emphasis on flowery and nectar aroma, in addition to mild buttery and acacia flower &#40;green bean&#41; notes, whilst maintaining the constant strength and fragrance throughout multiple steepings. As&nbsp;is typical for&nbsp;Long Xiang Tie Guan Yin, this tea has been allowed to ferment at room temperature with plenty of hand shaking, as opposed to bamboo drum shaking, resulting in heavier fermentation and slightly higher oxidation rate, generally believed to be at approximately 30% for this style of tea, thus giving a depth rather than a strength of flavour. </span></span></p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><span><span>Grown high up in the mountains of YangShan Village, within Gande township, which is considered to be one of the premium locations for the best Tie Guan Yin, this Long Xiang is made by a family of master Sujindui and his wife WuLaiYing. His tea grows at an altitude of 1500-1700 metres above sea level, away from town pollution and excessive heat and tea insects &#40;though we have still seen some on the leaves&#41;. Situated on steep terraces, where the half-metre-high bushes are allowed to compete with moderate amounts of natural vegetation to ensure competition, the natural selection, in combination with the hard&nbsp;work and experience&nbsp;of Sujindui results in this excellent quality Long Xiang Tie Guan Yin.</span></span></p></div>,

The Qing Xiang is less oxidised compared to the Nong Xiang, with an oxidation level of approximately 10%, as opposed to approximately 30% in Nong Xiang.

           <p>&nbsp;</p>
           
           <p><em><strong>Introduction To Tongmu Teas</strong></em></p>
           
           <p>Tongmu Guan is situated within the Wuyishan Nature Reserve due to its unique ecosystem and terroir. The volcanic origin of the soil here has given rise to great biodiversity and unique soil. The high altitude of Master Xiang’s tea mountain, the steep mountain slopes and the unique soil have all given rise to&nbsp;perfect conditions, allowing for slow growth of the tea trees, which has given rise to the sweet, aromatic, yet surprisingly subtle and complex flavour to all of his teas.</p>
           
           <p>&nbsp;</p>
           
           <p>Additionally, the protected status means the tea is grown without the use of chemicals (it is left untended during the year), with a very clean mountain environment where the tea grows, soaking up the clean fresh mountain air and fed by clear mountain springs.</p>
           
           <p>&nbsp;</p>
           
           <p>The Eastcott&amp;Burgess teas are sourced from one of the highest points in Tongmu, giving rise to the most Tongmu-characteristic flavour, with subtle, but lingering sweetness and often with notes of apple skin.</p>
           
           <p>&nbsp;</p>
           
           <p><em><strong><span><span>On The Search of Our Tea Master</span></span></strong></em></p>
           
           <p>Before we even arrived in Wuyishan, we were very keen to find a Tongmu tea master who could show us growing and making his tea himself.</p>
           
           <p>&nbsp;</p>
           
           <p>There were lots of Tongmu tea shops in Wuyishan, but we wanted to source our tea straight from the tea masters, rather than resellers (for reasons of price and authenticity).</p>
           
           <p>&nbsp;</p>
           
           <p>Thus, we were EXTREMELY lucky to be able to find such a tea master on the final day before we had to depart China. It meant a lot of preliminary hard work for us though, asking everyone we met during our trip if they could help us visit Tongmu. Eventually, our wish was granted and we were introduced to Master Xiang by a friend of a friend of a friend we made during our travels. Therefore, we are hugely grateful that we could connect with Master Xiang and witness the tea growth and production with our own eyes.</p>
           
           <p>&nbsp;</p>
           
           <p><em><strong>Production Process</strong></em></p>
           
           <p>The production process of Xiao Chi Gan&nbsp;follows a similar pattern to that of&nbsp;the smoked Lapsang (which is made of the larger Da Chi Gan leaves), except the smoking process is, of course, skipped, and the process takes place in another building (not in the smoking room) and uses electricity.</p>
           
           <p>&nbsp;</p>
           
           <p>Although there are usually several rounds of tea picking during the year for Tongmu teas, as we have been told by Master Xiang, this tea is made from the finest spring leaves,&nbsp;plucked on May 18th&nbsp;2018. The leaves then underwent a period of gentle drying, rubbing to break up the cell walls and to shape the leaves into neat strips, and fermentation, to remove the bitter and astringent notes in the leaves and to allow the tea to turn red. Fermentation takes place in bamboo woven baskets, covered by cloth, releasing a strong, mouth-watering scent of chocolate and malted barley extract all around it. The next step in the process is baking ('hong pei') to remove the remainders of water in the leaves and to inspire the sweet, aromatic notes in the leaves. The temperature, at no time, should reach above 80-85C. The tea is then sorted,&nbsp;to remove stalks and bad leaves, and then baked again, for the second time, to remove any water the tea has absorbed, having been in contact with oxygen during the sorting process.</p>
           
           <p>&nbsp;</p>
           
           <p>The second baking process (‘Ti Xiang’) is one of the trickiest steps in the process and many manufacturers of these teas tend to skip it. This is becasue the tea is baked at over 200C and thus it is very easy to completely ruin a mediocre tea with it. The Xiang family, however, are very confident about their tea and thus undergo it.</p></div>,

        <p>o <strong>Water type:</strong> we strongly recommend to use water that most closely resembles the birthplace water of this tea e.g. sweet spring bottled water</p>
        
        <p>o<strong>&nbsp;Leaf to water ratio:&nbsp;</strong>7 grams for standard gaiwan</p>
        
        <p>o<strong>&nbsp;Method:&nbsp;</strong>flush the leaves with 95C&nbsp;water for 4 seconds to cleanse the tea leaves (as per the Chinese tradition), to warm them up and to allow them to expand and open up slightly.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>Steep the first brew for 15&nbsp;seconds with 95C water and keep increasing the steeping time with 4&nbsp;seconds with each subsequent brew.&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>We like to enjoy this tea up to 10&nbsp;steepings maximum, with the 5th and 6th steepings being our favourite, though our Chinese friends, who are great tea lovers we met at Wen Da Shi's, liked this particular Ya Shi up to 15 steepings.</p></div>,

        body:<div><p><span><span>This Ya Shi comes from Wudong, which is considered to be the birth place of the best Dan Cong near Fenghuanzhen (Phoenix town), hence the best Dan Cong in China and in the world. The Da Shi (Master) is one of the four most renowned tea masters throughout the entire&nbsp;Fenghuang mountains, who were awarded the title of the Inheritor of Intangible Cultural Heritage of China, but his tea also grows at some of the highest and thus most favourable altitudes of the four tea masters.</span></span></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><span><span>Ya Shi Xiang directly translates as “duck shit fragrance” tea. Legends about the origins of its name aside, this Ya Shi is a very fragrant Dan Cong, with fruity, malty and buttery notes. According to our tasting experience, what separates it apart from other Wen family Dan Congs, is its strong reminiscence of lychee and peaches.</span></span></p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><span><span>This tea is highly prized, because it takes incredible care to cultivate the perfect tea bush for so many years, in fact, decades. Once picked, most of the premium Dan Congs, in addition to multi-stage processing attributable to other Oolongs, and Ya Shi&nbsp;being one of them – have to undergo medium to heavy roasting, which is done in 4-12-hour intervals, where tea roasting has to be regularly inspected by the tea master.</span></span></p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><span><span>This tea comes from the Fenghuang Shan (mountain), from Wudong Cun (village), which is situated at an altitude of 1100-1200 metres above sea level. Away from pollution of Fenghuangzhen, this Ya Shi benefits from the spring mountain water which constantly runs through the long roots of an old bush, and silty-rocky terroir, which in combination enrich the tea with minerals and unique sweetness, which is only typical of Wudong.</span></span></p></div>,

        <p>Mi Lan Xiang translates as “honey orchid fragrance” tea. This Mi Lan comes from the Mi Lan varietal tea bushes, all of which are 30 years old at the time of plucking. The reference to honey in the name is believed to refer to the flavour of bees wax, rather than honey itself. Nonetheless, as its name suggests, it still brings in strong honey and flowery notes, which to us was more resembling of violets and roses, with strong malty notes, reminding us of a bready fruit cake. Malty notes are very typical of medium roast Dan Cong teas.</p>

        body:<div><p><span><span>This Xing Ren comes from Wudong, which is considered to be the birth place of the best Dan Cong near Fenghuanzhen (Phoenix town), hence the best Dan Cong in China and thus in the world. The Da Shi (Master) is one of the four most renowned tea masters throughout the entire&nbsp;Fenghuang mountains, who were awarded the title of the Inheritor of Intangible Cultural Heritage of China, but his tea also grows at some of the highest and thus most favourable altitudes of the four tea masters.</span></span></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><span><span>Xing Ren Xiang directly translates as “almond fragrance, or apricot stone fragrance” tea. This Xing Ren Xiang comes from Xing Reng varietal tea bushes, all of which are 30 years old at the time of plucking. We think that its name suggests a very sweet flavour, which we agree it has, but we could not taste almonds, nor apricots specifically </span></span><span><span><span>😊. </span></span></span><span><span>Nevertheless, it is a very sweet Dan Cong tea compared to other Dan Congs from Wen family, and it also has floral, buttery, Asian mango and fruit cake notes in its flavour.</span></span></p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><span><span>This tea is highly prized, because it takes incredible care to cultivate the perfect tea bush for so many years, in fact, decades. Once picked, most of the premium Dan Congs, in addition to multi-stage processing attributable to other Oolongs, and Xing Ren being one of them – have to undergo medium to heavy roasting, which is done in 4-12-hour intervals, where tea roasting has to be regularly inspected by the tea master.</span></span></p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><span><span>This tea comes from the Fenghuang Shan (mountain), from Wudong Cun (village), which is situated at an altitude of 1100-1200 metres above sea level. </span></span><span><span>Away from pollution of Fenghuangzhen, this Xing Ren benefits from the spring mountain water which constantly runs through the long roots of an old bush, and silty-rocky terroir, which in combination enrich the tea with minerals and unique sweetness, which is only typical of Wudong.</span></span></p></div>,

This is because,&nbsp;as put simply, not many Chinese people want Tie Luo Han, compared to the market for Rou Gui and Shui Xian.

        title:"Tea Story",
        body:<div><p>This is Rou Gui from the Hui Yuan Keng area of Zheng Yan. Zhengyan, which translates as "true rock", is the tiny "Champagne"&nbsp;region of Yan Chas, and tea from here is most desirable. Zhengyan is subdivided into areas, each one having a name, where tea families used to live a decade a so ago. Each area has its own story and its own tea price, which changes year to year, depending on fashion and demand. However, Zhengyan has now been designated Nature Reserve with a special protected status, meaning no residential activities are allowed anymore. Thus, the original families, who used to live here, have been relocated by compulsory order, but the land remains within their ownership.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>Hui Yuan Keng is a beautiful&nbsp;area within Zhengyan, and it is so far away within it, that one needs to wake up at&nbsp;5am&nbsp;in the morning to be able to reach the place, pick enough tea leaves, and return home to the village before dusk.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>It is grown on steep terraces, in the unique terroir of weathered tectonic crust, constant water run-through, hidden by the rocks from excessive midday sun heat, and protected by extra moisture from the fog. The fog forms&nbsp;naturally around the Yan Chas in Zheng Yan, because there is a river, Jiuqu, which meanders through the nature reserve of Zheng Yan. All of these conditions have to be met for such a sought-after tea, as the Huang family’s Rou Gui.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>Very strong tobacco notes in the flavour, with faint toasty and malty notes, and a rather strong whiskey aroma are&nbsp;predominant. These are&nbsp;the key features of good quality Zheng Yan Rou Gui. Although often sold and presented as a very masculine tea in China (is one of the favourite teas of the current General Secretary of the Communist Party&nbsp;of China, Xi Jinping, as we were told in Wuyishan), this tea really appealed to me, and I would like to share it with you.</p>

        body:<div><p><span><span>Huang Guan Yin is a newly developed oolong - this cultivar was introduced in the year 2003&nbsp;by the Fujian Tea Research Institute in the Wuyi mountains, and it is a very popular tea in China too. We immediately learned why, as soon as we tried it from a few different tea masters, for the first time in our lives, whilst in China. </span></span></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><span><span>This tea tastes like a mixture between traditional Tie Guan Yin and a classic Wuyi Yan Cha, although, in reality, it is a mixture between Huang Jin Gui and Tie Guan Yin. Since it is produced mainly in Wuyishan&nbsp;and it is roasted in the style of a Yan Cha, but, has roots of Tie Guan Yin, it has two predominant groups of tasting&nbsp;notes.&nbsp;The first one strongly reminds us of tobacco and leather, whereas the second one reminds us of flowers and nectar, just like Long Xiang Tie Guan Yin would do!</span></span></p>

        <p><span><span>This is one of the most highly reveered teas the Xiang family have, thus Master Xiang makes us stop talking, become very still and gentle with our movements, as to not damage the buds by careless movement, and to then listen carefully to our sensations.

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><span><span>Jin Jun Mei from Tongmu&nbsp;is generally believed to be more umami than sweet, compared to the other Tongmu teas, but we still found it pleasantly sweet.</span></span></p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><em><strong><span><span>Introduction To Tongmu Teas</span></span></strong></em></p>
        
        <p><span><span>Tongmu Guan is situated within the Wuyishan Nature Reserve due to its unique ecosystem and terroir. The volcanic origin of the soil here has given rise to great biodiversity and unique soil. The high altitude of Master Xiang’s tea mountain, the steep mountain slopes and the unique soil have all given rise to&nbsp;perfect conditions, allowing for slow growth of the tea trees, which has given rise to the sweet, aromatic, yet surprisingly subtle and complex flavour to all of his teas. </span></span></p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><span><span>Additionally, the protected status means the tea is grown without the use of chemicals (it is left untended during the year), with a very clean mountain environment where the tea grows, soaking up the clean fresh mountain air and fed by clear mountain springs.</span></span></p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><span><span>The Eastcott &amp; Burgess teas are sourced from one of the highest points in Tongmu, giving rise to the most Tongmu-characteristic flavour, with </span></span>subtle, but lingering sweetness and often with notes of apple skin.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><em><strong><span><span>On The Search of Our Tea Master</span></span></strong></em></p>
        
        <p>Before we even arrived in Wuyishan, we were very keen to find a Tongmu tea master who could show us growing and making his tea himself.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>There were lots of Tongmu tea shops in Wuyishan, but we wanted to source our tea straight from the tea masters, rather than resellers (for reasons of price and authenticity).</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>Thus, we were EXTREMELY lucky to be able to find such a tea master on the final day before we had to depart China. It meant a lot of preliminary hard work for us though, asking everyone we met during our trip if they could help us visit Tongmu. Eventually, our wish was granted and we were introduced to Master Xiang by a friend of a friend of a friend we made during our travels. Therefore, we are hugely grateful that we could connect with Master Xiang and witness the tea growth and production with our own eyes.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><em><strong><span><span>Production Process</span></span></strong></em></p>
        
        <p><span><span>The production process of Jin Jun Mei follows a similar pattern to that of Xiao Chi Gan, except the methodology involves&nbsp;movements, which are much more gentle, due to the tenderness of the buds. </span></span></p>

        <p><span><span>Although there are usually several rounds of tea picking during the year for Tongmu teas, as we have been told by Master Xiang, this tea is made from the finest spring leaves,&nbsp;plucked on May 18th&nbsp;2018. The leaves then underwent a period of gentle drying, rubbing to break up the cell walls and to shape the leaves into neat strips, and fermentation, to remove the bitter and astringent notes in the leaves and to allow the tea to turn red. Fermentation takes place in bamboo woven baskets, covered by cloth, releasing a strong, mouth-watering scent of chocolate and malted barley extract all around it. The next step in the process is baking ('hong pei') to remove the remainders of water in the leaves and to inspire the sweet, aromatic notes in the leaves. The temperature, at no time, should reach above 80-85C. The tea is then sorted,&nbsp;to remove stalks and bad leaves, and then baked again, for the second time, to remove any water the tea has absorbed, having been in contact with oxygen during the sorting process. </span></span></p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><span><span>The second baking process (‘Ti Xiang’) is one of the trickiest steps in the process and many manufacturers of these teas tend to skip it. This is becasue the tea is baked at over 200C and thus it is very easy to completely ruin a mediocre tea with it. The Xiang family, however, are very confident about their tea and thus undergo it.</span></span></p></div>,

        title:"Tea Story",
        body:<div><p><em><strong>Introduction To Tongmu Teas</strong></em></p>

        <p>Tongmu Guan is situated within the Wuyishan Nature Reserve due to its unique ecosystem and terroir. The volcanic origin of the soil here has given rise to great biodiversity and unique soil. The high altitude of Master Xiang’s tea mountain, the steep mountain slopes and the unique soil have all given rise to&nbsp;perfect conditions, allowing for slow growth of the tea trees, which has given rise to the sweet, aromatic, yet surprisingly subtle and complex flavour to all of his teas.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>Additionally, the protected status means the tea is grown without the use of chemicals (it is left untended during the year), with a very clean mountain environment where the tea grows, soaking up the clean fresh mountain air and fed by clear mountain springs.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>The Eastcott&amp;Burgess teas are sourced from one of the highest points in Tongmu, giving rise to the most Tongmu-characteristic flavour, with subtle, but lingering sweetness and often with notes of apple skin.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><em><strong><span><span>On The Search of Our Tea Master</span></span></strong></em></p>
        
        <p>Before we even arrived in Wuyishan, we were very keen to find a Tongmu tea master who could show us growing and making his tea himself.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>There were lots of Tongmu tea shops in Wuyishan, but we wanted to source our tea straight from the tea masters, rather than resellers (for reasons of price and authenticity).</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>Thus, we were EXTREMELY lucky to be able to find such a tea master on the final day before we had to depart China. It meant a lot of preliminary hard work for us though, asking everyone we met during our trip if they could help us visit Tongmu. Eventually, our wish was granted and we were introduced to Master Xiang by a friend of a friend of a friend we made during our travels. Therefore, we are hugely grateful that we could connect with Master Xiang and witness the tea growth and production with our own eyes.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><em><strong><span><span>Prejudice Dispelled</span></span></strong></em></p>
        
        <p><span><span>Back in the UK, we have heard from certain tea vendors that the traditional smoked ‘Lapsang Suochong’ is actually inferior to the unsmoked version, being a mistake tea, which was accidentally contaminated with smoke and was then sold onto foreigners. The people we have spoken to in China, in both Wuyishan and in Tongmu, have never heard of such a story. Both, the smoked and the unsmoked varieties are equivocally loved by the Chinese tea connoseurs. Thus, we encourage you to approach this tea with an open heart, without any prejudices. </span></span></p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><em><strong><span><span>The Tea Tree</span></span></strong></em></p>
        
        <p><span><span>This tea is made from a tea tree planted by Master Xiang’s grandfather 70-80 years ago on the mountain at an altitude of 1,300 m within the Tongmu Nature Reserve. The leaves used for this tea are the 3rd leaves from the top of each tree branch, which is larger than the leaves used for Xiao Chigan, and thus they taste different to Xiao Chigan with a more mineral sweetness. </span></span></p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><em><strong><span><span>Why So Little Is Produced </span></span></strong></em></p>
        
        <p><span><span>The leaves are smoked over two days by an ancient Ma Son pine in the </span></span>Qing Lou (the smoke house)<span><span>. Tongmu being a Nature Reserve, no tree is allowed to be felled, thus the smoking process uses a pine fallen by natural causes. Following this, a permit was acquired by the government to use this pine prior to smoking this tea.</span></span></p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><em><strong><span><span>Production Process</span></span></strong></em></p>
        
        <p><span><span>The production process of this tea uses traditional methods relied upon for centuries, of course, without the use of electricity. </span></span></p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>It follows a similar pattern to that of Xiao Chi Gan, except the use of of Da Chi Gan leaves, instead of Xiao Ch Gan leavels. Additionally, the entire process takes place in a special smoking building and uses no electricity, hence the roots of this method are completely traditional, as has been done for centuries.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>Although there are usually several rounds of tea picking during the year for Tongmu teas, as we have been told by Master Xiang, this tea is made from the finest spring leaves,&nbsp;plucked on May 18th&nbsp;2018. The leaves are then brought into the smoking building.&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><span><span>The pine is set alight in the basement of the smoking building and when it starts to smoke, the tea is placed on each of the 4 floors above, depending on the desired level of smoking. The floors are porous and thus the smoke permeates gently into the tea. In the smoking building, there are&nbsp;tea trays for different stages stages of tea making (wilting, drying, smoking), which are fixed onto the wooden ceiling shelves right below each bamboo tile of the smoking building floor, to be gently smoked by the smoke that comes up through spaces between the bamboo weavings. </span></span></p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><span><span>After the highly labour intensive two days of smoking, and the tea master ending up being smoked himself, the tea is finished. </span></span></p></div>,

This is a truly stunning territory and what in Russia is known as a Zapovednik (a strictly protected Nature Reserve). This special classification means that it is protected by the Russian government. This makes it almost impossible for any sort of development to take place, it also means that all plants, herbs, and animals of the Zapovednik are protected. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This protection was first introduced during communist times and continues to be praised by ecologists worldwide. Development is sparse (it should be non-existent, however corruption means that some hotels in central Dombay continue to spring up) and travel here is rather difficult (due to a lack of formal public transport). Although this is a rather popular place to visit among Russians, the appeal is its remoteness and natural beauty, which has actually helped to stop it from becoming an overly developed tourist attraction (like you see in other parts of the world). There are several state run sanatoriums in the Caucasus Mountains, where people are prescribed natural remedies (with Dombay Mountain tea being a must because of its ecological cleanliness and supposed health benefits) along with regular exercise, natural food, and even fasting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While out there, we were lucky enough to explore some of the remotest and most beautiful parts of Dombay, thanks to our dad (a regular visitor), leading the way. On our treks, we would pick herbs (and berries) and pack them into our rucksacks. Most parts of the Zapoveddnik are not accessible by car and so the herbs we picked grew naturally and were not contaminated with pollutants, pesticides and the like. Every evening we would boil these up in a pot and sit silently, sipping the tea. We didn’t have the energy to talk, let alone stand (no exaggeration).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Growing up, this tea would be our go to during any illness. On our visit to Russia, a relative or friend would usually pass on the herbs they had picked and dried during a trip and after returning to the UK we would have to ration our supplies throughout the year (along with our sparse supply of May honey).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>During our trip this year we wanted to find some tea we could take back. While in Russia, you will often see herbal teas being sold by local souvenir traders as ‘Dombaysky Chay’. The problem is that all Zapovenik zones are protected (often by guards) and it would be close to impossible to remove enough herbs to make this a viable business model. This means that a lot of these tisanes are actually grown and picked elsewhere and are most certainly not as ecologically clean. The trick to finding the good stuff it to find an old lady sitting on a stool by the side of the road (usually with a handkerchief holding her hair back and an apron round her waist) with a strange assortment of stuff in front of her. There are many such ladies in Russia trying to make it by on their measly state pension by selling whatever they are able to pick, grow, or cook themselves. Luckily, we found one such lady trading very close to our AirBnB. Everything from sunflower seeds she had pan fried, to the elusive ‘Dombayski Chay’. We snatched up everything she had and thanked her for the tea. This is the tea you see in front of you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We really hope you like it. We only have 300g of the stuff. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sasha</p></div>,

           <p>As my tastes in tea have developed it has become more difficult to say which tea is my favourite. However, this is certainly one of my favourites. I personally think that this tea should be experimented with and steeped using both Gong Fu and Western. The reason is that it takes what some may call ‘over-steeping’ amazingly. It has almost no astringency. So definitely give both types a go (even if you are a Gong Fu&nbsp;geek like me).</p>

        <p>The tea takes its name from the eponymous "Dragon Well" located near Longjing village, the origin of this tea; due to the nature of the water that the well contains, after rainfall, one can supposedly see shapes in its waters that were thought to resemble the Chinese dragon.</p>
        
        <p>According to the legend, The Kangxi Emperor's grandson of the Qing dynasty, the Qianlong Emperor, visited West Lake during one of his famous holidays and was so impressed by this tea that it was granted the status of Gong Cha, or imperial tea, by the Kangxi Emperor.</p>

           <p>I love our Longjing as its flavour contains more of the rich roasted, nutty and sweet notes in addition to its savoury vegetal notes and a velvety smooth mouthfeel, for which Dragonwell is renowned, compared to your traditional Dragonwell. This gives it an intense richness and a satisfying finish. This intensity does come with a bit of astringency if over-steeped. Thus you need to be careful (as with all Longjings).</p>

           <p>Use about 4-6g of tea to one Gaiwan, steeped at 90°C. Steep in 15 second flushes. Re-steep as many times as you like. As a guideline, Yunnan Gold (Dian Hong) usually starts to fade out after 3-4 steepings.</p></div>,
